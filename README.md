# TCP Protocol Over UDP

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). While TCP and UDP are distinct protocols, this implementation showcases how TCP-like features can be simulated over a connectionless protocol like UDP.

## Introduction

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. On the other hand, UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking. This project aims to combine the best of both worlds by implementing a TCP-like mechanism over UDP.

## Features

- Reliable message delivery
- Ordered message transmission
- Basic flow control
- Error detection and correction

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tcp-over-udp.git
cd tcp-over-udp
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# For Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Node.js
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the server:

```bash
# For Python
python server.py

# For Node.js
node server.js
```

To run the client:

```bash
# For Python
python client.py

# For Node.js
node client.js
```

## Examples

### Sending a Message

1. Start the server.
2. Run the client and send a message.
3. Observe the server receiving the message reliably.

### Handling Packet Loss

This implementation includes mechanisms to handle packet loss and retransmission, simulating TCP behavior over UDP.
